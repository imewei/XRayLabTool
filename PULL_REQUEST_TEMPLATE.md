# Pull Request: API Refactoring for Improved Readability (v0.5.0)

## üéØ Overview

This pull request introduces significant improvements to the XRayLabTool API to enhance code readability and follow Julia naming conventions. **All changes maintain backward compatibility through deprecation warnings.**

## üîÑ Breaking Changes (with Deprecation Support)

### New Function Names
- `calculate_xray_properties()` replaces `Refrac()` (for multiple materials)
- `calculate_single_material_properties()` replaces `SubRefrac()` (for single materials)

### New Struct Field Names
- `molecular_weight` (was `MW`)
- `number_of_electrons` (was `Number_Of_Electrons`)
- `mass_density` (was `Density`)
- `critical_angle` (was `Critical_Angle`)
- `attenuation_length` (was `Attenuation_Length`)
- `real_sld` (was `reSLD`)
- `imag_sld` (was `imSLD`)

### New Internal Function Names
- `atomic_number_and_mass()` (was `get_atomic_data()`)
- `load_scattering_factor_table()` (was `load_f1f2_table()`)
- `pchip_interpolators()` (was `create_interpolators()`)
- `accumulate_optical_coefficients!()` (was `calculate_scattering_factors!()`)

## ‚úÖ Backward Compatibility

- **All old function names still work** - they now show deprecation warnings with clear migration instructions
- **All old struct field names accessible** - via custom `getproperty` method
- **No performance regression** - same optimized code paths
- **All tests pass** - existing test suite runs without modification

## üìã Changes Made

### Version Updates
- [x] Bumped version from 0.4.1 ‚Üí 0.5.0 in Project.toml
- [x] Updated compatibility constraints

### Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md with migration guide
- [x] Updated README.md with new API examples
- [x] Enhanced docstrings with deprecation warnings
- [x] Added migration examples for both APIs

### Code Changes
- [x] Implemented new function names as primary interface
- [x] Added deprecation warnings with `@deprecate` macro
- [x] Updated struct with new field names
- [x] Added backward compatibility via `getproperty` override
- [x] Improved variable names throughout codebase
- [x] Enhanced constant names for clarity

### Testing
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] Backward compatibility validated
- [x] New API functionality tested

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Users
```julia
# Before (still works, shows warnings)
results = Refrac(["SiO2", "Al2O3"], [8.0, 10.0], [2.2, 3.95])
result = SubRefrac("SiO2", [8.0, 10.0], 2.2)
println(result.MW, result.Critical_Angle[1])

# After (recommended)
results = calculate_xray_properties(["SiO2", "Al2O3"], [8.0, 10.0], [2.2, 3.95])
result = calculate_single_material_properties("SiO2", [8.0, 10.0], 2.2)
println(result.molecular_weight, result.critical_angle[1])
```

### Deprecation Timeline
- **v0.5.0**: Old API deprecated with warnings
- **v0.6.0+**: Continued support with warnings
- **v1.0.0**: Old API will be removed (estimated 6 months)

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing Commands
```bash
# Run full test suite
julia --project -e "using Pkg; Pkg.test()"

# Test backward compatibility
julia --project -e "using XRayLabTool; Refrac([\"SiO2\"], [8.0], [2.2])"  # Should show deprecation warning

# Test new API
julia --project -e "using XRayLabTool; calculate_xray_properties([\"SiO2\"], [8.0], [2.2])"  # Should work without warnings
```

### CI Validation Needed
- [ ] Julia 1.10+ compatibility
- [ ] All tests pass on multiple platforms
- [ ] Documentation builds correctly
- [ ] Package installation works
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (no regression expected)

## üìä Performance Impact

- **No performance degradation** - all optimizations retained
- **Caching system unchanged** - performance improvements maintained
- **Memory usage identical** - same data structures and algorithms
- **Thread safety maintained** - parallel processing still supported

## üîç Review Checklist

### Code Quality
- [x] Function names follow Julia conventions (snake_case)
- [x] Variable names are descriptive and clear
- [x] Constants have meaningful names
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

### Documentation
- [x] CHANGELOG.md documents all changes
- [x] README.md shows both old and new APIs
- [x] Docstrings include deprecation warnings
- [x] Migration examples provided
- [x] Field name mapping clearly documented

### Testing
- [x] Existing tests pass without modification
- [x] Deprecation warnings work correctly
- [x] New API functions work as expected
- [x] Field name compatibility verified
- [x] Error handling unchanged

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

1. **Merge this PR** after review and CI validation
2. **Tag v0.5.0** release with detailed release notes
3. **Announce changes** in relevant channels with migration guide
4. **Monitor usage** and provide migration support as needed
5. **Plan v1.0.0** removal of deprecated API (6+ months)

## üìû Support

If users need help migrating their code:
1. Deprecation warnings provide exact replacement instructions
2. Documentation shows side-by-side examples
3. Issues can be opened for complex migration scenarios
4. All changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md

## ü§ù Request for Review

**Please review:**
- [ ] API naming choices and consistency
- [ ] Backward compatibility approach
- [ ] Documentation clarity and completeness
- [ ] Migration guide usefulness
- [ ] CI/testing strategy
- [ ] Version bump appropriateness (0.4.1 ‚Üí 0.5.0)

**Specific areas needing attention:**
1. **Deprecation warnings** - Are they clear and helpful?
2. **Field name mapping** - Is the `getproperty` approach robust?
3. **Documentation** - Does it clearly explain the migration path?
4. **Version strategy** - Is 0.5.0 appropriate for these changes?
